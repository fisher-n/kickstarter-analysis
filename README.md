# Finding from analysis

May is the best month to launch a play based on the analysis of theater outcomes by launch date. December is the less successful month to launch a play. Goals requesting up to $4,999 had the most success. While productions with goals of $45,000 or more were the least successful. Suggesting plays with lower goals had higher success than larger goals. Some limitations of this dataset would be that it does not show how the campaigns were advertised outside of creating a single kickstarter. There could be many outside factors of how campaigns were advocated by external sources, like social media and word of mouth. It also has limited data on the type or story of the play. More analysis could go into creating graphs of deadline and launch date to help display how that affected successful fundraising. Could also create a visual of how many people would be needed for donations based on average donation to reach a successful fundraising.
